# Progression (as implemented)

## Recipe unlock caches
- `lore_cache` unlocks:
  1. `craft_crude_torch`
  2. `mix_resin_sealant`

- `workbench_blueprint_cache` unlocks:
  1. `basic_workbench` (station)
  2. `carve_wooden_shaft` (recipe)

## Crafting tier
- Crafting tier is stored on the player.
- Current milestone:
  - Claiming a craft job that outputs `crude_torch` bumps you to **tier 1** (if you were below).

## What this enables
- Tier 1 is required for Tier 1 recipes (e.g. workbench recipes).
