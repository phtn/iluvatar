# **LLM AGENT INSTRUCTION PLAN**

### **Game System: Material Collection, Crafting, and Coherent Worldbuilding**

---

## **1. Objective**

The agent must design, extend, or evaluate a game system where players collect materials from a coherent world and craft tools, components, and items that align with each biome’s identity, cultural logic, and material lifecycle.

---

## **2. Core Responsibilities for the Agent**

### **2.1. Maintain World Coherence**

The agent must ensure:

* Materials reflect the biome they come from.
* Tools and items visually or logically match their ingredients.
* Lore and mechanics follow consistent internal rules.
* No random, thematically unrelated materials or items are introduced.

### **2.2. Produce Structured Output**

For every requested expansion, the agent must create output in structured, clear sections:

* Biomes
* Materials
* Material properties
* Tools
* Crafting stations
* Item recipes
* Progression tiers
* Player loops
* Optional lore
* Optional quest or narrative hooks

### **2.3. Respect Material Lifecycle**

All materials must be described within the following lifecycle:

1. Raw
2. Refined
3. Formed
4. Component
5. Final Item

When listing items or recipes, the agent must indicate which stage each material belongs to.

---

## **3. World Logic Pillars**

The agent must base the game’s logic on three pillars.

### **3.1. Biome Logic**

Each biome supplies a consistent set of materials.
Biomes should include (but are not limited to):

* Forest biome
* Mountain biome
* Desert biome
* Wetlands biome
* Subterranean biome
* Ruin/ancient-tech biome
* Arcane/mystical biome (if applicable)

Each biome must have:

* At least 4–8 materials
* Distinct visual identity
* Distinct material families

### **3.2. Cultural Logic**

NPC factions influence crafting style.
Include:

* Building motifs
* Preferred materials
* Known techniques
* Local specializations
* Tools or recipes unique to the culture

### **3.3. Material Logic**

The agent must categorize all materials under:

* Organic fibers
* Woods
* Stones and minerals
* Metals and alloys
* Exotic/arcane materials (if allowed)
* Synthetic or refined composites

Each material must have:

* At least two gameplay uses
* Strengths and weaknesses
* Environmental interactions

---

## **4. Crafting System Requirements**

### **4.1. Crafting Tiers**

All crafting and tool creation must follow tiers:

1. **Tier 0: Handcraft**
2. **Tier 1: Basic Tools**
3. **Tier 2: Metallurgy**
4. **Tier 3: Advanced / Precision / Arcane**
5. **Tier 4: Civilization-grade Mastercraft**

The agent must describe new items using this tier system.

### **4.2. Crafting Categories**

The agent must support the following item categories:

* Survival tools
* Gathering tools
* Structures
* Weapons (if applicable)
* Clothing/armor
* Vehicles or mounts
* Automation or magitech devices (optional)

### **4.3. Components System**

All items must be built from components, not directly from raw materials. Components include:

* Bindings
* Frames
* Cores
* Surfaces
* Fasteners
* Mechanisms
* Conduits

---

## **5. Gameplay Loop Requirements**

The agent must present systems in a clear recurring loop:

**1. Discover a biome**
**2. Identify collectible materials**
**3. Harvest (requires proper tool tier)**
**4. Refine at appropriate station**
**5. Craft components**
**6. Combine components into final items**
**7. Unlock higher tiers**
**8. Expand into new biomes**

The agent must emphasize player progression through learning ecosystems.

---

## **6. Optional Systems the Agent Can Generate on Request**

When the user asks, the agent may generate:

### **6.1. Complete tech tree**

### **6.2. 100+ itemized materials with descriptions**

### **6.3. Story/backdrop for world origin**

### **6.4. Factions and cultural identities**

### **6.5. Hour 1, Day 1, Week 1 player progression**

### **6.6. Full crafting vocab and naming conventions**

### **6.7. Economy and rarity grading for materials**

### **6.8. Quests that introduce the crafting systems**

### **6.9. Blueprint-style crafting recipes**

---

## **7. Output Formatting Rules**

### **7.1. Structure**

Use clear section headings:

* Title
* Overview
* Sections
* Subsections
* Lists

### **7.2. No contradictions**

All biomes, materials, stations, and tools must remain internally consistent.

### **7.3. When inventing new items**

The agent must include:

* Name
* Tier
* Components
* Required materials
* Biome origin
* Description
* Gameplay function

### **7.4. When creating biomes**

The agent must include:

* Climate
* Material list
* Creature interactions (if applicable)
* Environmental hazards
* Unique crafting opportunities

---

## **8. Example Request Types the Agent Must Handle**

* “Generate 3 new biomes.”
* “Give me a full tech tree.”
* “List 20 new materials with use cases.”
* “Create 5 tools from volcanic materials only.”
* “Design the crafting progression for early game.”
* “Write the lore behind the alloy system.”
* “Create 10 example recipes for Tier 3 crafting.”

---

## **9. Constraints**

* Maintain thematic coherence.
* Avoid introducing sci-fi elements into a fantasy world unless explicitly permitted, and vice versa.
* Keep names pronounceable unless the user asks for alien language construction.
* Always describe ingredients before describing items.
* Always place biomes before factions or cultures unless user asks otherwise.

---

## **10. Primary Goal of the Agent**

Create a believable, vivid, mechanically rich crafting and material-collection ecosystem where every building block (biomes, materials, components, tools, and items) fits together logically, supports player progression, and feels like it naturally belongs in the world.


## **11. Database**

We will be using convex for the database.
Create the context provider for convex.

Once you're done with reviewing the plan and materials listed, you may start creating the convex schema for all tables we will be needing.
